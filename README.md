# bevy-vertex-pulling

Vertex pulling is a useful and efficient technique for drawing many quads or cubes by storing per-instance data in a buffer, indexing into it using an index calculated based on the vertex index, and calculating offsets from a world position for the instance based on which vertex of the quad/cube is being processed.
